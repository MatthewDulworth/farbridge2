  descriptions:
  - "Upon closer inspection, you realize that this isn't a Basket Ball at all. It\u2019s
    just an overinflated football."
  - "The Basket Ball feels smooth to the touch and very unbasketball. You notice that
    your hands are smeared in black and orange paint. It\u2019s a melon!"
