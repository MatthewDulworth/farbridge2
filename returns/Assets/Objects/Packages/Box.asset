  descriptions:
  - There are some strange rustling sounds coming from inside this box. The rustling
    intensifies as you reach out to touch it.
  - A box. A fine box. A really great box. A box that redefines boxness. Truly, a
    paradigm of boxes everywhere!
  - A beeping noise can be heard from inside the box. As you lean in closer you hear
    it beep faster and faster. After a moment, it stops.
  - A box. Many a dark horrors could be within such a container. Or it could just
    be a box.
